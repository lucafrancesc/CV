## Profile

I am an enthusiastic student who enjoy to be relied on and would go over and beyond to help colleagues and peers.
I am a reliable team player who enjoys problem solving.
I strive to achieve success and I am always keen to expand my knowledge.

For the past three years I worked as team leader in hotel operations.
I came across quite challenging situations which supported me to become a more confident and charismatic individual.

I want to become an experienced and skilled developer.
I really enjoy coding as it allows me to use my problem solving skills.
